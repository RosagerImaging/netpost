# Verify rollback
curl https://your-domain.com/api/health
```

### Emergency Deployment

**Hotfix Deployment Process:**
1. Create hotfix branch from production
2. Implement minimal fix
3. Deploy directly to staging for verification
4. Deploy to production with minimal downtime
5. Monitor closely for 30 minutes post-deployment

## Database Maintenance

- [ ] Vacuum and analyze tables (PostgreSQL)
- [ ] Review storage usage and cleanup
- [ ] Test database restore procedures

**Commands:**
```sql
-- Check database health
SELECT pg_database_size('netpost_production');

-- Find slow queries
SELECT query, mean_time, calls 
FROM pg_stat_statements 
ORDER BY mean_time DESC 
LIMIT 10;

-- Check connection usage
SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity;
```

## Security Updates

### Security Patch Management

- **High**: Deploy within 7 days
- **Medium**: Include in next scheduled maintenance
- **Low**: Include in quarterly updates

**Security Update Process:**
1. **Assessment**
   - Review security advisory
   - Assess impact on NetPost
   - Determine urgency level

2. **Testing**
   - Test security update in development
   - Run security scans
   - Verify no functionality breaks

3. **Deployment**
   - Follow standard or emergency deployment procedures
   - Monitor security metrics post-deployment

### Security Monitoring

**Daily Security Checks:**
- [ ] Review failed authentication attempts
- [ ] Check for unusual API usage patterns
- [ ] Monitor SSL certificate status
- [ ] Review firewall logs

**Weekly Security Review:**
- [ ] Dependency vulnerability scan
- [ ] Review user access permissions
- [ ] Check for suspicious database queries
- [ ] Audit configuration changes

## Backup Procedures

### Automated Backups

**Database Backups:**
- **Frequency**: Daily at 2:00 AM UTC
- **Retention**: 30 days for daily, 12 months for monthly
