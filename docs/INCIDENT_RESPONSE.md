## Incident Response Process

### Phase 1: Detection and Alerting (0-5 minutes)

**Incident Detection Sources:**
- Automated monitoring alerts

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Acknowledge the incident**
   - Silence repeating alerts
   - Log initial incident details
   - Start incident timer

2. **Initial Assessment**
   - Determine severity level
   - Identify affected systems/users
   - Estimate business impact

3. **Activate Response Team**
   - Page appropriate team members based on severity
   - Establish communication channels
   - Designate Incident Commander

### Phase 2: Initial Response (5-30 minutes)

**Incident Commander Actions:**
1. **Establish War Room**
   - Create incident-specific Slack channel: `#incident-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM`
   - Set up video conference for real-time coordination
   - Document incident details in tracking system

2. **Stakeholder Notification**
   - Notify internal stakeholders
   - Prepare customer communication (if needed)
   - Update status page

3. **Resource Mobilization**
   - Assign technical leads
   - Ensure necessary tools and access
   - Coordinate with external vendors (if needed)

**Technical Team Actions:**
1. **System Assessment**

   # Check overall system health
   curl https://your-domain.com/api/health
   curl https://your-domain.com/api/monitoring/metrics
   curl https://your-domain.com/api/monitoring/performance
   ```

2. **Log Analysis**
   ```bash
   # Check recent errors
   curl https://your-domain.com/api/monitoring/alerts?status=active
   ```

3. **Initial Mitigation**
   - Implement immediate fixes if obvious
   - Consider rollback if recent deployment
   - Apply circuit breakers or rate limiting

### Phase 3: Investigation and Mitigation (30 minutes - 2 hours)

**Investigation Process:**
1. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Review system metrics and logs
   - Identify timeline of events
   - Correlate with recent changes
   - Test hypotheses systematically

2. **Impact Assessment**
   - Quantify affected users
   - Measure business impact
   - Assess data integrity
   - Document system state

3. **Solution Development**
   - Develop fix strategy
   - Test proposed solutions in staging
   - Plan implementation approach
   - Prepare rollback procedures

**Common Investigation Commands:**
```bash
# Database health check
curl https://your-domain.com/api/monitoring/health/detailed

# Performance metrics
curl https://your-domain.com/api/monitoring/performance

# Recent deployment check
vercel ls

# Error rate analysis
curl https://your-domain.com/api/monitoring/alerts
```

### Phase 4: Resolution and Recovery (Varies by incident)

**Resolution Steps:**
1. **Implement Fix**
   - Deploy hotfix if needed
   - Update configurations
   - Restart services if required
   - Verify resolution in staging first

2. **Validation**
   - Confirm system functionality
   - Run smoke tests
   - Monitor key metrics
   - Verify user experience

3. **System Recovery**
   - Restore full service capacity
   - Clear alerts and monitoring issues
   - Resume normal operations
   - Document resolution steps

## Communication Protocols
